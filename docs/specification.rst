Improving SBOL itself
================================

.. note::
         The current SBOL data model, validation rules, best practices and other
         details are described in the SBOL specification:
         http://sbolstandard.org/downloads/specification-data-model-2-0/. The
         specification is also an excellent source of reference in case you
         wonder about the meaning of a field or other details.

Technical details concerning SBOL are discussed among the SBOL developer
group (http://sbolstandard.org/development/developers/). Contact the SBOL
editors at editors at sbolstandard.org to join this list.
