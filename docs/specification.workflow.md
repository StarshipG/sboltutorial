## How to discuss SBOL changes

In order to avoid endless circular discussions on mailing lists, we have a
somewhat formalized workflow for changing and improving SBOL:

1. ask a question on sbol-dev

2. register issue on the spec issue tracker

3. Editors classify issues into "Needs SEP" or "Non-SEP"

4. git-fork the SEP repo

5. Drafting an SEP with feedback discussions on sbol-dev or other channels

6. Send a pull request to Editors

7. discuss SEP on sbol-dev; modify; back to 6
